## Overview 
This is the data behind the story **What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?**.

The masculinity survey contains the results of a survey of 1,615 adult men. They were asked 98 questions or less depending on their previous answers. You can find the article using this [link](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man/).


```{r global-options, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
# library(tidyverse)
# library(knitr)
# library(kableExtra)
```


Install and Load libraries 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

Load the data
```{r load_data}
masculinity_survey = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/masculinity-survey/raw-responses.csv")
```

## Data manipulation

Find the length of the rows and columns in the data frame
```{r rows_and_columns_length}
nrow(masculinity_survey)
ncol(masculinity_survey)
```

We can select the columns we only care about for this analysis

```{r select_relevant_columns}
masculinity_survey2 <- masculinity_survey %>% 
  select(q0001,q0002,q0004_0001,age3,kids,orientation,weight)
```

Let's give meaningful names to our variables

- In general, how masculine or “manly” do you feel?: q0001
- How important is it to you that others see you as masculine?: q0002
- Where have you gotten your ideas about what it means to be a good man?: q0004_0001
- Age_Group: 18-33, 34-65, 65 and up
- Has kids
- Sexual orientation

```{r relevant_columns}
masculinity_survey2 <- masculinity_survey2 %>% 
  rename(Feel_Masculine = q0001, 
         Importance_of_Masculinity = q0002,
         Ideas_About_Good_Manhood = q0004_0001,
         Age_Group = age3,
         Has_Kids = kids,
         Sexual_Orientation = orientation,
         Weight = weight)
```

Let's load the first 10 observations of the data

```{r glimpse_of_the_data}
head(masculinity_survey2,10) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

## Conclusions

These are few questions I can ask to complete this article.

Comparative Analysis:

- How do the feelings of masculinity differ between individuals with and without children (Has_Kids)?
- Are there differences in the importance of masculinity among different sexual orientations?

Correlation Analysis:

- Is there a correlation between age and feelings of masculinity?
- Is there a correlation between the importance of masculinity and weight?
